/**
*	\var SoundStaticParam START_TIME
*		- When placed in a Score, the sound will start at this time.
**/

/**
*	\var SoundStaticParam DURATION
*		- The sound lasts this long (in seconds)
**/

/**
*	\var SoundStaticParam LOUDNESS
*		- Describes how loud the sound should be perceived 
*		  at its loudest point.
*		- Given in Sones, the valid range is [0,255]
**/

/**
*	\var SoundStaticParam LOUDNESS_RATE
*		- Loudness does not have to be calculated EVERY sample.
*		- This specifies how often loudness is calculated.
*		- the default is 10Hz.
**/

/**
*	\var SoundStaticParam DETUNE_SPREAD
*		- Detuning describes the effect of letting all partials
*		  exponentially converge from random points to their intended
*		  frequencies, or to diverge in the reverse fashion
*		- Detuning spread refers to the the variance in frequences
*		  at the divergent end of the sound (the beginning for
*		  convergence (tuning), the end for divergence (detuning))
*		- A value of 0.0 effectively disables detuning
*		- A value of, say, 0.3 causes the detuned frequencies to fall
*		  within the range [(1.0-0.3)*Freq, (1.0+0.3)*Freq].  In other
*		  words, the SPREAD value is a percent that corresponds to a
*		  range in which the partial will (randomly) fall at the max.
*		  detuning portion of the sound.
**/

/**
*	\var SoundStaticParam DETUNE_DIRECTION
*		- -1.0 means do detuning (divergence)
*		- +1.0 means do tuning (convergence)
**/

/**
*	\var SoundStaticParam DETUNE_VELOCITY
*		- Values over [-1.0, +1.0]
*		- For VELOCITY=0.5, the transition will be linear from start
*		  to end.  For Velocity = -1.0, the transition will be nearly
*		  instantaneous and immediate (and exponentially 
*		  interpolated).  For velocity +1.0, the transition will be 
*		  instantaneous, but will occur at the extreme end of the 
*		  sound (And will be exponentially interpolated)
*		- If y is the amount of tuning and x is time, think of -1.0 as
*		  a vertical line on the left (at the beginning) and then a flat
*		  horizontal line.  For +1.0, the horizontal line is at the 
*		  beginning (on the left), and there is a sharp transition at
*		  the right end (at the end).
